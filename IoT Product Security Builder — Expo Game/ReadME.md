# IoT Secure Development Questionnaire Game

## Overview

The IoT Secure Development Questionnaire Game is an interactive web-based tool designed to evaluate and enhance awareness of secure product development practices for IoT devices. The game presents a series of security-related questions covering critical areas in embedded systems, firmware, and network security. Players select answers to score points, and their performance is tracked for continuous improvement.

## Features

* 10 security-focused questions relevant to IoT secure development.
* Multiple-choice format with 5 randomized answer options per question.
* Real-time score calculation and leaderboard functionality.
* Persistent score storage for tracking player progress across sessions.
* Professional, clean interface for training and demonstration purposes.
* Prototype builder integration to simulate IoT device security configurations based on chosen answers.

## Objectives

* Assess knowledge of secure IoT product design principles.
* Reinforce best practices in areas such as:

  * Secure boot
  * Hardware security modules (HSM)
  * Debug port management
  * Network segmentation
  * Secure firmware updates
* Identify potential vulnerabilities based on participant responses.

## Benefits

* **Training and Awareness**: Enhances understanding of IoT security principles among developers, testers, and engineers.
* **Assessment Tool**: Allows organizations to measure and benchmark internal security knowledge.
* **Risk Identification**: Highlights potential weak points in the product development lifecycle.
* **Engagement**: Encourages participation through gamification, making security training interactive and effective.
* **Repeatable Learning**: Persistent score storage supports ongoing improvement and performance tracking.

## How to Use

1. Open the game in a supported browser.
2. Enter your name to register as a player.
3. Answer all questions by selecting one option per question.
4. Submit your answers to view your security score.
5. Review the leaderboard to compare results with other players.
6. Repeat the quiz periodically to measure improvement.

## Technical Requirements

* A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.
* Local storage enabled for persistent score saving.
* No server-side dependencies; runs fully in-browser.
